# Snake Game using SFML Library

This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game developed using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It was created between November and December 2023, offering a unique twist to the traditional Snake game mechanics.

## Project Overview

The game operates on a modified Snake concept where the snake dynamically decreases in size if the player inputs a conflicting direction while the snake is already moving in a specific direction. For instance, if the snake is heading left and the player presses right immediately (Instead of pressing up and then right normally), the snake's size reduces and vice versa. This mechanic adds an extra layer of challenge to the gameplay.

Additionally, plus it was my first game so it was hard to understand the machanics at first and will improve in future, the game restarts automatically upon collision with the borders, making it an endless gameplay experience. The only way to exit the game is by pressing the designated exit button.

## Classes Implemented

1. **Texture**: Handles loading and managing textures for game elements.
2. **Sprite**: Manages the sprites used in the game, such as the snake and food items.
3. **Coordinates**: stores and keep track of the coordinates (X Axis & Y Axis). 
4. 4. **Snake**: Assign the coordinates for the snake.
5. **Fruit**: Assign the coordinates for the snake.

## Requirements

This project utilizes SFML, a powerful but older multimedia library. Ensure you have the necessary SFML libraries installed to run the game successfully.

## How to Run

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have SFML installed and properly configured.
3. Compile the project using your preferred compiler, linking the SFML libraries.
4. Run the compiled executable file.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the snake's direction.
- Press the designated exit key (ESC) to close the game.
